App url: https://nc-news-project-cs.netlify.app/articles

The NC-News app shows an array of different articles which the user may interact with and view. The user would be able to sort the articles and filter the articles by topic, they would also be able to up or down vote any of the articles and leave or delete their own comments. To add or remove comments the user would need to be logged in (for this project a valid username to use for testing would be cooljmessy).

Back-end code: https://github.com/ChannersSoh/api-project
